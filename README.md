# Chatbot-using-rasa-framework
I have created a simple chatbot which returns timezone of few cities to user 
You can test bot created by me as follow
1) Install python on your system
2) Using pip install rasa (You can also install rasa x. It provides GUI)
3) Download timezonebot folder from above
4) Open another cmd and type 'rasa run actions' command
5) Open cmd in timezonebot folder and type 'rasa train' command. It will train model based on changes made by me
6) Cmd in which you have typed 'rasa run actions' command in the same cmd type 'rasa shell' command as soon as training finishes
7) Now you can communicate with my chatbot
8) You can ask simple questions 
- like Is this a bot?
 - hey
 - hello
 - are you a bot?
 - i need to find a time zone
 - can you find me a time zone
